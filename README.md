# partybot

to run on your own side, add a file called bot_token.py with a single variable called 'token' which is a string of your token

runs on the old version of discord.py so you need that too (new version doesn't seem to have ytdl support)

to-do:\n
	-maybe make the commands more solid instead of a "startswith" deal, so that way it would be easier to add arguments. this could lead to custom song link parties\n
	-find out if there is a way to play another song at the end of one\n
	-find out if youtube playlists can work\n
